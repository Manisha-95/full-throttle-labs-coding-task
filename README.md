# full-throttle-labs-coding-task

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/full-throttle-labs-coding-task)



On click of View button the modal will open with the date and time which they were active based on the activity periods.
Inside the model you will get to find more button below which will shows the all activity periods of that respective person.
For json data fetch i used the mock api server by postman.io site.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you need any changes on that.

Thanks
